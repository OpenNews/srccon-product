<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:PRODUCT</span></div>

<p>Product managers play a key role in bridging the gap between executives, newsrooms, revenue teams, and the audience each serves. And “product thinking” is a skill practiced by many within today’s news organizations, regardless of job title. SRCCON:PRODUCT will <a href="https://opennews.org/blog/announcing-srccon-product">bring together these many kinds of product thinkers</a> to focus on this question:</p>

<p class="quote">“How do we make news organizations more audience-oriented, data-driven and product-focused?”</p>

<p>That’s a big question, and sessions throughout SRCCON:PRODUCT will dive into many ways we might start answering it. The program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We’ll confirm some cornerstone sessions in advance, and fill in any open space on the schedule as a group in a conversation to open the day.</p>

<div class="page-divider"><span>Who is this event for?</span></div>

<p>The discussions and workshops at SRCCON:PRODUCT will lead to the best ideas when they include the experiences of people from many backgrounds, roles, and organizations. This is an event for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>people already working in product management and development for news, who want to be part of a larger community changing journalism</li>
  <li>people doing the often-invisible work of bringing product thinking to their newsroom, regardless of role or title</li>
  <li>people who want to better understand how organizing around product can shift the way news organizations operate</li>
</ul>

<p>We learn best when we learn from each other, and SRCCON events are built to support you in bringing who you are and what you have to share with this community.</p>

<div class="page-divider"><span>Tickets &amp; attending</span></div>

<p>Tickets for SRCCON:PRODUCT will be $125 plus ticketing fees. Early-bird applications will be open December 16-18, 2019, and regular applications will remain open through January 9, 2020.</p>

<p>SRCCON:PRODUCT will be intentionally small, at about 150 participants. This size means we need to be equitable in distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills represented. Our call for participation form will help us understand who would like to take part and what you’re hoping to take home with you.</p>

<p>The form will also include an application for travel support. Scholarships will provide a $350 stipend, with a limited number of $500 stipends available for folks with higher travel costs.</p>

<div class="page-divider"><span>Our rough schedule for the day</span></div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9am:</strong> Registration opens</li>
  <li><strong>10am:</strong> Event opens</li>
  <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Sessions &amp; conversation-friendly breaks</li>
