## Venue

SRCCON:PRODUCT will take place at the [Student Center](https://goo.gl/maps/AvYSqhRTMs4C14nR8) on Temple Unviersity's campus in North Philadelphia.

## Schedule

**Date:** February 8, 2020

Our rough schedule for the day:

* **9am:** Registration opens
* **10am:** Event opens
* **Morning:** Sessions & conversation-friendly breaks
* **Midday:** Lunch at SRCCON:PRODUCT with the people you meet
* **Afternoon:** More sessions, snacks, & conversation-friendly breaks
* **6pm:** Event closing

We expect it to be a busy, fun, and productive day where we all take away new ideas and stronger connections with colleagues. We're still finalizing the precise final schedule, but expect that participants from train distance away may arrive in the morning and leave in the evening.

## Hotel

Temple University is on an urban campus in a residential neighborhood without large hotels nearby. We booked a discounted hotel block a short Broad Street Line subway ride away in Center City. There are several other large, chain hotels a similar distance from the venue, with easy access to the Broad Street Line (Broad Street replaces 14th Street in Philadelphia).

You can [use this link to book at the Hampton Inn](https://secure3.hilton.com/en_US/hp/reservation/book.htm?inputModule=HOTEL&ctyhocn=PHLCVHX&spec_plan=CHHSRC&arrival=20200207&departure=20200210&cid=OM,WW,HILTONLINK,EN,DirectLink&fromId=HILTONLINKDIRECT), where we have a discount block, with a registration deadline of January 17. The nightly rate will be $129 plus taxes and includes free hot breakfast. 

## Getting around Philly

If you're coming to Philly on Amtrak, you'll get off at 30th Street Station. The Amtrak station is a half-block away from the Market-Frankford subway line, which you can take east to get into Center City and to hotels near the venue. The local transit organization is [SEPTA](http://septa.org/). You will need to buy a [refillable Key Card](http://www.septa.org/fares/pass/key.html) from kiosks at stations. If you see "North Philadelphia" as an option as a stop for your train, you could get off there and take the Broad Street Line south to the Temple University stop.

Coming from the airport, there is a commuter train that also gets you into Center City or cabs have flat rate fares into Center City.

Temple University's main campus is right in the middle of a residential neighborhood. It is very accessible by transit, with numerous hotels in Center City a few blocks walk away from the City Hall, Walnut/Locust, and Race/Vine stops on the Broad Street Line. The Temple University stop is a few blocks from the Student Center venue. Buses take similar north south routes and can get you within one block of the venue.

If you have any questions or would like more information about other ways to access the venue, [please let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Meals at SRCCON

We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON:PRODUCT, so we’re providing lunch, plus we’ll have tea, coffee, and snacks—both healthy and sugary—throughout the day as well. 

## Tickets and attendance

Tickets for SRCCON:PRODUCT are $125 plus ticketing fees. We distributed tickets via a call for participation form that has now closed.

SRCCON:PRODUCT will be intentionally small, at about 150 participants. This size means we need to be equitable in distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills represented. Our call for participation form helped us understand what participants were interested in bringing to and getting out of the event.

## Accessibility

The Temple venue and all of the rooms we will be using are fully ADA accessible, with ramps and an elevator to reach rooms around the venue. The food we provide will be labeled, and we'll have options for all dietary needs. We ask about any accommodation needs as part of registration, but if you have any additional thoughts or questions, [please reach out](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Childcare

We offer free childcare throughout SRCCON:PRODUCT by connecting you with a local provider. If you would like more information, please [let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Alcoholics Anonymous

The closest meeting to SRCCON:PRODUCT hotels is Saturday night at 7pm, at [Church of St Luke & the Epiphany](https://www.aasepia.org/?meeting=meeting-330-s-13th-st-philadelphia-pa-19107-usa-6-190000), 330 S. 13th St. It is an “open” meeting, meaning that you don’t have to be alcoholic to go. AA SEPIA also hosts [a full list of area meetings](http://www.aasepia.org/meetings/).

## Coming soon

We'll keep updating this page with more details about what to expect before and during SRCCON:PRODUCT. Stay tuned!
