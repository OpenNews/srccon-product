# Connecting to Temple’s Guest Wireless Network

_These instructions [are provided by Temple University's Information Technology Services](https://its.temple.edu/sites/its/files/imce/TempleGuestWirelessAccess.pdf). If you need assistance, they provide a help desk at 215-204-8000._

**Before You Begin:** If you are visiting from a participating Eduroam institution, you can log in to the eduroam wireless network as an alternative to the instructions below. For more information, go to [its.temple.edu/eduroam](its.temple.edu/eduroam).

1. Connect to the **TUguestwireless** network by selecting it from the list of available Wi-Fi networks.
2. Open the browser on your device. In the Guest Registration window:  
    a) Type your name and cell phone number.  
    b) Click the box next to **I accept the terms of use**.  
    c) Click **Register**.  
3. You will receive a text message with your assigned password. Copy this password because you will need it to connect to **TUsecurewireless**.
4. Connect to the **TUsecurewirelessnetwork**.
5. Enter the username (your cell phone number) and password exactly as they appear in the text message received on your cell phone. Include any parentheses, periods, dashes or spaces you previously entered for your cell phone number.

**Notes:**

* Once you are registered, you can use the same username and password to connect from any device.
* Temple uses a text messaging service from Twilio, Inc. that reaches almost every mobile carrier worldwide. For a list of countries that are covered, go to [www.twilio.com/sms/coverage](www.twilio.com/sms/coverage).
