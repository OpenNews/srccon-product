We’re working hard to build relationships, but we have no systematic way to record them or leverage them for growth, greater impact, or revenue. \n\nWe're stuck with only growth-hacking techniques like paid lead generation because we can’t capitalize on the community maps we have in our heads. It limits our growth, and it means we lose those relationships when someone in the news organization moves on.\n\nIt’s past time for a new CRM—a community relationship management system.",

We'll highlight some homespun product brief formats and off-the-shelf templates, like those found on strategyzer.com. We'll also invite others to share their formats of choice.\n\nIn the second half of the session, we'll divide into groups for an exercise.

In this session, we’ll get together to discuss our definition of, and experiences with, experimentation—what’s worked, what hasn’t, and what we mean by an experiment in the first place.\n\nWe’ll use the XDPD framework, in which experiments are seen as a structured way of asking and answering questions, to generate a set of experiment-ready questions.
