In this session, we’ll hear what kinds of communication and culture problems you’ve identified in your newsrooms, dig into tools– like OKRs, team health checks and user manuals– that can provide a shared vocabulary in and across teams, and help you and your colleagues feel more heard and satisfied in your newsrooms, whether it’s a large organization or a startup",

There are many established methods of product development to inspire and focus teams—Sprint, Lean, Agile, Kanban—all of which focus on solutions to customer and business problems. Enter XDPD, or Experiment-Driven Product Development—a new approach that turns the spotlight on questions to be answered, rather than on solutions.\nWithin XDPD, discovery is a mindset, not a project phase. In this session, I'll introduce a philosophy of product development that will hone your skills in discovery, research and learning. By guiding you through a practical, immediately applicable framework, you can learn to ask, and answer, questions which will supercharge your product development, making teams smarter and better at developing products and services that deliver for users and businesses alike.\nWhen applying the XDPD framework within your organization, the concept of an experiment—a structured way of asking, and answering, questions—becomes the foundation of almost everything you do, instilling a constant sense of discovery that keeps your team inspired. All types of activities, from data analysis to writing software, are seen through the lens of research. Rather than treating research as a separate task from the rest of product development, this session approaches the entire practice as one of research and continuous discovery.\nDesigning successful experiments takes practice. In the session, we'll run through step-by-step tools to ensure that meaningful, efficient progress is made with each experiment, discuss and practice designing some experiments.",

In the second half of the session, we'll divide into groups for an exercise. Each group will use a different template to boil down a common product that we pitch to the group.
