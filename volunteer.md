# Volunteer at SRCCON events

We need YOU to help make SRCCON events work. Participants run sessions and other parts of the program throughout each conference, and we also need a small group of people to help us keep these events running smoothly. Want to help? Consider volunteering.

Volunteers will help with:

* registration
* supporting session leaders
* set-up and clean-up
* those unexpected tasks that always come up during an event

Volunteering will be a significant time commitment. For offering that time and missing out on some (but not all!) of the festivities, you will have our gratitude, a free ticket to the event, a SRCCON Volunteer T-shirt, and the knowledge that you played an integral role in making this SRCCON event a success.

If you want to attend and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, [please email us for information](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) about volunteering.
