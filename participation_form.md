# SRCCON:PRODUCT call for participation

We can't wait to hear how you'd like to participate at SRCCON:PRODUCT! If you want to attend, facilitate a session, or take part in some other way, this one form is where to let us know.

This event is a collaborative project, with a product thinking advisory group that is also involved in organizing along with OpenNews staff. Your form responses may be shared with that group as part of the process developing an event that meets the needs of this community.

If you're working on a session idea, we highly recommend reading through [this guide to crafting great session proposals for SRCCON-style events](https://srccon.org/sessions/proposal-guide/). Please feel free to reach out to us at [srccon@opennews.org](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) with any questions. Or if you're all set, the participation form is below!
