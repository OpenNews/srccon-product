<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:PRODUCT</span></div>

Product managers play a key role in bridging the gap between executives, newsrooms, revenue teams, and the audience each serves. And “product thinking” is a skill practiced by many within today’s news organizations, regardless of job title. SRCCON:PRODUCT will bring together these many kinds of product thinkers to focus on this question:

<p class="quote">“How do we make news organizations more audience-oriented, data-driven and product-focused?”</p>

Sessions throughout SRCCON:PRODUCT will dive into many facets: The business of journalism is at a tipping point. Is scale dead? Can advertising support aggressive local news-gathering efforts? Is reader revenue the future? How prepared are our organizations to adapt and survive? And how can we be and do better?

The program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We'll confirm some cornerstone sessions in advance, and add more topics to the schedule as a group in a conversation that opens the day.
