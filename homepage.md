Product managers play a key role in bridging the gap between executives, newsrooms, revenue teams, and the audience each serves. And “product thinking” is a skill practiced by many within today’s news organizations, regardless of job title. SRCCON:PRODUCT will [bring together these many kinds of product thinkers](https://opennews.org/blog/announcing-srccon-product) to focus on this question:

<p class="quote">“How do we make news organizations more audience-oriented, data-driven and product-focused?”</p>

That's a big question, and sessions throughout SRCCON:PRODUCT will dive into many ways we might start answering it. The program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We'll confirm some cornerstone sessions in advance, and fill in any open space on the schedule as a group in a conversation to open the day.

<div class="page-divider"><span>Who is this event for?</span></div>

The discussions and workshops at SRCCON:PRODUCT will lead to the best ideas when they include the experiences of people from many backgrounds, roles, and organizations. This is an event for:

* people already working in product management and development for news, who want to be part of a larger community changing journalism
* people doing the often-invisible work of bringing product thinking to their newsroom, regardless of role or title 
* people who want to better understand how organizing around product can shift the way news organizations operate
