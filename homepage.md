<div class="page-divider"><span>About SRCCON:PRODUCT</span></div>

Product managers play a key role in bridging the gap between executives, newsrooms, revenue teams, and the audience each serves. And “product thinking” is a skill practiced by many within today’s news organizations, regardless of job title. SRCCON:PRODUCT will [bring together these many kinds of product thinkers](https://opennews.org/blog/announcing-srccon-product) to focus on this question:

<p class="quote">“How do we make news organizations more audience-oriented, data-driven and product-focused?”</p>

That's a big question, and sessions throughout SRCCON:PRODUCT will dive into many ways we might start answering it. The program will be collaborative, created and led by community members. We'll confirm some cornerstone sessions in advance, and fill in any open space on the schedule as a group in a conversation to open the day.

<div class="page-divider"><span>Who is this event for?</span></div>

The discussions and workshops at SRCCON:PRODUCT will lead to the best ideas when they include the experiences of people from many backgrounds, roles, and organizations. This is an event for:

* people already working in product management and development for news, who want to be part of a larger community changing journalism
* people doing the often-invisible work of bringing product thinking to their newsroom, regardless of role or title 
* people who want to better understand how organizing around product can shift the way news organizations operate

For folks from smaller newsrooms who are new to product, there is also a [Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms training program](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/training/product-immersion) from NewsCatalyst and the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY that has been developed in partnership with Google News Initiative. Participants in that program will also attend SRCCON:PRODUCT and begin in-person training the day following. There is a [separate application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFUhfL8a5j42vggGj2nrRCVQn_0ih6DC8TGG-qeExbn6a4lg/viewform) for this program.

<div class="page-divider"><span>Tickets & attending</span></div>

Tickets for SRCCON:PRODUCT will be $125 plus ticketing fees. [Applications are open till January 9, 2020](/participation/form). (Early bird applications closed on December 18.)

SRCCON:PRODUCT will be intentionally small, at about 150 participants. This size means we need to be equitable in distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills represented. Our call for participation form will help us understand who would like to take part and what you're hoping to take home with you.

[The form also includes](/participation/form) an application for travel support. Scholarships will provide a free ticket to the event and a $350 stipend, with a limited number of larger stipends available for folks with higher travel costs and international participants.
